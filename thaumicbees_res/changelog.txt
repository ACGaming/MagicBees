1.1.702-67 - Replaced 1.1.702-62
Additional Magic Capsules, featuring ExtraBees liquids, and RailCraft Creosote & Steam. (Yes, steam capsules. It's magic. That's how. :P)
Tagged additional Forestry items with Thaumcraft aspects.

1.1.702-62
Added Magic Capsules!
Compatible with BuildCraft and Forestry liquids, they function almost the same way as refactory capsules, except that they can store 2 buckets' worth of liquid. As such, you cannot right-click with them to scoop up water or lava, but you can use them in bottlers, carpenters, Railcraft's Iron Tanks, Thermal Expansion's liquid transposers, and other things that support the Forge Liquid Dictionary. They can be useful for storing larger amounts of liquids in chests and things. I am also able to add other liquids to them in the future, and liquids from mods that are not present will not appear in the Creative inventory or the NEI listings.

1.0.701-56
Update to Forestry 1.7.0.1/1.7.0.2

Added all kinds of backpack integration for Thaumcraft, including a new Thaumaturge's Backpack and Woven variety. These will suck up shards, Thaumcraft resources such as quicksilver, amber, zombie brains, research fragments and other goodies. Other TC items such as marker blocks, warded stone, candles, logs, leaves and plants also can fall into Forestry's default backpacks as appropriate. (I may have missed some other obvious items.)
